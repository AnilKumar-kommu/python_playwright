name= 'anil kuamr'
age=30
height=6

# this way we can write as basic by using the concatenating the presses
print('my name is ',name, 'and my age is ',age,'and my height is ',height)

# now we can write the all by using the  "f function" like below -- just add wht you need in the flow and give the variable time as {} is ok
print(f'my name is {name} and my age is {age}and my height is {height}')

#my using this we cane give math operation in midile with f functions
print(f'my name is {name} and my father age is {age*2}')
